## Reporting a Vulnerability

Huelet takes security vulnerabilities **very** seriously. Please **do not** make a GitHub issue/pull request so as to avoid further publicity before we push a patch.
Instead, please e-mail us at [hi@huelet.net](mailto:hi@huelet.net) with details of the vulnerablility. If you have code that you think can fix the problem, please send a
link to a forked git repository with the changes.  
  
Thank you for making Huelet a better platform together.
