Quick note on how to read error codes written here

All errors returned to the client will always start with 0x

The first digit after the 0x will always be 0 or 1. If it is 0, the error is non-fatal. If it is 1, the error is fatal.
The second digit after the 0x will always be 0 or 1. If it is 0, the error is a problem with the user's input. If it is 1, the error is a bug. This defaults to 1.
Digits 3 - 5 will identify the error. This is a unique number for each error. If you are contributing to the project and adding an error, please write it down here.
